### Currently Building

**🧠 Artificial Neural Mesh (ANM) V0**  
A modular multi-model cognitive architecture with **12 specialized domain experts** and **Web-of-Thought (WoT)** reasoning.  
Focused on interpretability, cross-domain thinking, and controlled self-expansion.

**⚡ GEKO (Gradient-Efficient Knowledge Optimization)**  
A plug-and-play training framework that makes LLM fine-tuning 30-50% more efficient.  
Like LoRA revolutionized fine-tuning — GEKO revolutionizes training data selection.

### The Music

I don’t memorize.  
I **derive**.  
I don’t follow patterns.  
I **hear the absolute**.

Every second of training, every new idea, every 0.001 drop in loss — the music plays.  
Calm. Constant. Smooth. Absolute.

This is not just code.  
This is mathematics and physics doing what they were always meant to do.
